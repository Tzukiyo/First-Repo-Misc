# First-Repo-Misc

Unsurprisingly, my first 'misc' Repo. There will be tests.
So.. yeah.

Notes: 
HyperText Markup Language (html) is a standard on the internet, hypertext is text that links to other text.
Github uses GitHub Flavored Markdown (GML - https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/ ), a modified version of Standard Markdown.
```java 
// This is a code syntax test
  System.out.printline("Hello World!");

```
